# PDH SDD GitHub's template

A general template for SDD/PDH projects, incorporating some good practices for github based development.

# Usage

To use this template create a new repository using this repository as a template. See in the top right corner of this page the green button "Use this template". Click on it and follow the instructions. This will create a new repository with the same structure as this one. Then clone the new repository to your local machine and start working on your project.

# Folder structure

There are four main folders in this repository:
- `docs`: Contains the documentation of the project.
- `src`: Contains the source code of the project.
- `raw_data`: Contains temporary local copies of the raw data used in the project. This folder won't be uploaded to the repository.
- `output`: Contains the temporary output files generated by the project (png, pdfs, small data units). This folder won't be uploaded to the repository.

# gitignore

The `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore the most common development temporary files for Python, R, and Stata. It also ignore most file formats in the `/temp/` subdirectories.
